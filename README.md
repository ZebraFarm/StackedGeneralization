# Overfitting in Stacked Generalization

This implementation of Generalized Stacking as implemented following the original [(Wolpert, 1992)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0893608005800231) and [(Briemann, 1996)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00117832) papers. Is being used to develop imperical results for a more indepth analysis of Stacking.

## Why?

The hope of this exploration of stacking is to discover over-fitting. 

## Then What?

If found techniques in Differential Privacy will then be utilized in the hope of mitigating the effects of the over trained data.

This project is being completed as the thesis component of my Honours Undergraduate degree at the Univeristy of Victoria (Victoria, BC, Canada).
