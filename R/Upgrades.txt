This program is working in a very tight controlled setting.

Throughout every step their are updates that can be achieved.

1: Data Generation
    - Allow ranges for each dimension
    - Different functions (true.models) for each dimension
    - Define error terms (easier)

2: Train Predict
    - Seperate leave-one-out and All better
    - Allow the number of different models to be specified
    - Make the option of choosing different models
    - Non-parametric Kernel Smoothing

3: Polynomial Regression
    - Implement Ridge Regression (Regularization)
    - Splines?

4: Generalize
    * My WLS estimates
    - Log Score

    - This is currently implemented with simple linear model coefficients
    - Maybe try another type of algorithm

5: Stacked Generalization
    - I could parallelize this

6: Statistics
    * replicates
    - Only recording MSE
    - Find best model?
    - Test as dimensions increase and parameters
        - Must finish Train_Predict (2), first!
    - Better Visuals with a plot the the Stacked Generalizer on the training data.

    * Stack Training and Test Results Together
